# Presentation
The following 2 design patterns were used, as required in the specs of Final Project
* Factory
* Circuit breaker
## Factory pattern
The Factory design is very useful at this early stage of Machu-Picchu because in the business model of Machu-Picchu each disguise will map directly to a wallet of a person-in-need

## Circuit Breaker pattern
The Circuit Breaker pattern is not immediately useful today but it will prove its usefulness later when fully deployed among a helper institution.
